In this project, residual image is being used for denoising application.

<!-- <h2>Residual Image</h2> -->

If Y is the noisy image and D is the denoised version of the noisy image then R=Y-D is called the residual image.
Intuitively, it would be an image containing all the noise and other components which were filtered out.
